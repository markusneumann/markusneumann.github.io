**Abstract:**

The study of non-policy representation has largely focused on either anecdotes or verbal communication by representatives. This neglects the crucial non-verbal component of symbolic representation. I argue that in order to convince their constituents that they are alike to them, and therefore will act in their interests, politicians project likeness through the way they talk: When speaking to an audience of ordinary citizens, a politician will play the average Joe; when addressing a congressional committee, they will demonstrate sophistication and competence. Hence, political speakers shift their style according to the audience. I test this hypothesis using audio data extracted from congressional and campaign speeches of U.S. senators uploaded to YouTube. I extract the acoustic properties of the audio signal and measure vowel space density, a concept developed in phonetics, which is used to measure the degree of articulation in speech. Armed with this measure, I show that politicians do indeed adjust their articulation to fit the needs of their audience.

**Abstract**:<br>
A local government's website is an important source of information about policies and procedures for residents, community stakeholders and scholars. Existing research in public administration, public policy, and political science has relied on manual methods of website content collection and processing, limiting the scale and scope of website content analysis. We develop a methodological pipeline that researchers can follow in order to gather, process, and analyze website content. Our approach, which represents a considerable improvement in scalability, involves downloading the entire contents of a website, extracting the text and discarding redundant information through a new method of boilerplate removal. We illustrate our methodological pipeline through the collection and analysis of a new and innovative dataset---the websites of over two hundred municipal governments in the United States. We build upon recent research that analyzes how variation in the partisan control of government relates to content made available on the government's website. Using a structural topic model, we find that cities with Democratic mayors provide more information on policy deliberation and crime control, whereas Republicans prioritize basic utilities and services such as water, electricity and fire safety.

**Class description:**

Students coming out of Stats 101 have a basic understanding of statistics. This class is designed to broaden that understanding and provide them with additional techniques and tools that can be used to understand, analyze and address more complicated data and hypotheses. This includes testing multiple hypotheses at once and examining the effects of variable interactions. It also includes moving from the simple cross-sectional data students saw in Stats 101 to time-series and panel samples, being able to handle binary and integer dependent variables, correct errors for common concerns over heteroskedasticity and clustering, and impute missing data. The goal is to make you a better consumer and producer of statistical analyses, something that will serve you well in your academic and professional career.

**Class description:**

This course explores the evolving relationship between computation and society. From algorithms shaping social behavior to the far-reaching impacts of artificial intelligence and big data, we examine how computational technologies influence and are influenced by societal norms, politics, and culture. Weâ€™ll also compare how these interactions differ across regions, including the US, China, Europe, and other parts of the world. The course spans areas such as social media dynamics, privacy in the digital age, misinformation, and the rise of automation, all while emphasizing the ethical, environmental, and cultural dimensions of technological advancement.

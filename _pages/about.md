I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Computational Social Science at Duke Kunshan University. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and Social Data Analytics from Penn State in August 2020, after which I spent three years as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Wesleyan Media Project.  My research revolves around the application of machine learning methods to social science problems, particularly in political advertising. I primarily work with multimodal data, including text, image, and audio.

I am a PhD candidate at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in Spring 2020. My research revolves around the application of machine learning and specifically natural language processing methods to social science problems, such as in political communication and representation. My work primarily deals with text and audio data, but also extends to image and network data as well as simulations. My [dissertation](https://markusneumann.github.io/research/phoneticstyleshifting) relies on tools from phonetics, electrical engineering and natural language processing to study how U.S. senators shift their rhetorical style in accordance with the representational needs of their audience.

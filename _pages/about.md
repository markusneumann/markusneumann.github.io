I am a PhD student at Penn State, in the Department of Political Science. I hold Bachelor and Master degrees in Political Science from the University of Mannheim, Germany, and a Master degree in Political Science from Penn State. I expect to finish my PhD in Spring 2020.

My primary interest lies in all things computational social science. Specifically, I focus on methods that aid me in the study of political communication and representation. Most of my work therefore lies in natural language processing, with research in both text as well as audio data. I am also interested in computer vision and other areas of machine learning.

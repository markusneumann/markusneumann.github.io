I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Wesleyan Media Project. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and Social Data Analytics from Penn State in August 2020. My research revolves around the application of machine learning and especially natural language processing methods to social science problems, such as in political communication and representation. My work primarily deals with text and audio data, but also extends to image and network data as well as simulations. My [dissertation](https://markusneumann.github.io/research/phoneticstyleshifting) relies on tools from phonetics, electrical engineering and natural language processing to study how U.S. senators shift their rhetorical style in accordance with the representational needs of their audience.

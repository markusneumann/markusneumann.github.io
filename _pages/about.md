I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Computational Social Science at Duke Kunshan University. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and Social Data Analytics from Penn State in 2020, after which I spent three years as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Wesleyan Media Project. I teach courses in computational social science, statistics, and the societal impact of computation. My research revolves around the application of machine learning methods to social science problems, particularly in political advertising. I primarily work with multimodal data, including text, images, and audio.
